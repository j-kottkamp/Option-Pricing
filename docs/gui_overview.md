## Option Pricing Module

### Purpose
The Option Pricing module evaluates theoretical option pricing models against specified market scenarios. This tool helps validate pricing accuracy and assess potential profitability under different market conditions.

### Key Features

#### Profit Estimation Analysis
The system calculates comprehensive profit metrics for option positions:
- **Net Profit**: Total expected profit from the position
- **Profit per Option**: Individual contract profitability
- **Return on Investment**: Percentage return based on initial capital

#### Supported Pricing Models

**Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM)**
The classical options pricing model assuming constant volatility and interest rates. Best suited for European-style options with stable underlying conditions.

**Markov-Switching Multifractal (MSM)**
Advanced model incorporating stochastic volatility that accounts for:
- Scale invariance in financial markets
- Fat tails in return distributions  
- Long-term persistence in volatility clustering
- Regime switching between different market states
- Timescale invariance

The MSM model uses the mathematical framework:
```
rt = σt · εt,    εt ~ N(0,1)
σt² = σ² · ∏(k=1 to K) Mk,t
```

Where volatility multipliers follow specific probability transitions, making it particularly effective for modeling real market dynamics.

#### Model Validation
The system employs Monte Carlo simulation with 100,000+ paths to ensure statistical robustness. This approach provides reliable profit estimates even under complex market scenarios.

### Use Cases
- Backtesting trading strategies before implementation
- Comparing theoretical fair value against market prices
- Risk assessment for different option positions
- Scenario analysis for varying market conditions

- **Strike Price**: Exercise price of the option  
- **Expiration Date**: Contract maturity date  
- **Option Type**: Call or Put designation  

### Market Data
- **Bid/Ask Prices**: Current market quotations  
- **Last Price**: Most recent transaction price  
- **Volume**: Trading activity for the session  
- **Open Interest**: Outstanding contracts  

### Risk Metrics
- **Implied Volatility**: Market's expectation of future volatility  
- **Moneyness**: Relationship between spot price and strike price  

### Advanced Analytics
- **Time to Maturity**: Remaining days until expiration  
- **Percentage Change**: Price movement analysis

## Model Comparison Framework

### Purpose
To identify pricing anomalies and inconsistencies across valuation models and market data, the system provides a robust model comparison toolset. This feature enables quantitative evaluation of:

- **Model vs. Market Discrepancies**  
- **Model vs. Model Divergences**  
- **Model vs. Fair Value Estimates**

### Core Features
- **Cross-Model Differential Analysis**: Compare pricing outputs of multiple valuation models (e.g. MSM, BSM, custom fair-value models) for identical option contracts.
- **Market Deviations**: Measure and visualize the deviation between theoretical model prices and observed market prices.
- **Model Consistency Checks**: Detect structural inconsistencies between different model families (e.g., stochastic volatility vs. constant volatility models).

### Visualization Tools
- **Difference Plotting**: Enables selection of specific contracts (by strike, expiry, moneyness, etc.) to plot absolute or relative differences across:
  - Model and market price  
  - MSM and fair MSM  
  - BSM and fair BSM  
  - Estimated vs. Implied volatility  
- **Dynamic Labeling**: Clearly distinguishes lines by model origin, ensuring interpretability of multi-line comparisons.
- **Anomaly Highlighting**: Automatically flags options with significant discrepancies (e.g. beyond z-score threshold or percentile rank) to pinpoint potential market inefficiencies.

### Practical Insights
- **Model Failures**: Spot pricing regions where a model breaks down (e.g., deep OTM options with unstable implied volatilities).
- **Market Inefficiencies**: Detect mispricings exploitable for arbitrage or hedging strategies.
- **Calibration Diagnostics**: Assess quality of model calibration via fair-value alignment checks.
- **Structural Patterns**: Identify systematic biases in pricing models over time or across maturities.

## GBM Path Generation

### Purpose
The Geometric Brownian Motion Generator creates sophisticated price path simulations essential for Monte Carlo analysis, risk management, and derivative pricing validation.

#### Mathematical Foundation
Geometric Brownian Motion follows the stochastic differential equation:
```
dS = μS dt + σS dW
```
Where:
- S represents the asset price
- μ is the drift (expected return)
- σ is the volatility parameter
- dW represents Wiener process increments

### Simulation Capabilities

#### Path Generation Features
