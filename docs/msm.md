# Markov-Switching Multifractal model

## Overview
- The Markov-Switching Multifractal model uses stochastic volatility components to model asset returns.
- It improves the combinatorial construction of the Multifractal Model of Asset Returns (MMAR) by modulating volatility with a set of hierarchical, Markov-switching multipliers.
- The model is designed to capture the complex dynamics of financial markets, including the presence of multiple regimes across different scales.
